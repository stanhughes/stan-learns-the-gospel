                        Welcome Message
                    </a>, by President Russell M. Nelson
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a very short talk. The following points caught my attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        We gather as a great global family desiring to worship our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
                    </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <i>desire</i> is the why of what we are doing and is very important. If the <i>desire</i> is 
                    wrong then the activity cannot be blessed by God. It is difficult to determine someone desire;
                    However, it is clear to God, Who grants unto us according to the righteous desires of our hearts, see

                  <q>
                    Some lessons that I knew before have been written on my heart in new and instructive ways.
                  </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This makes me think, What lessons I need to have <q>written on my heart in new and instructive ways</q>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <q>
                    ...the strength of the Church lies in the efforts and ever-growing testimonies of its members. 
                    Testimonies are best cultivated in the home...many of you have dramatically increased the 
                    study of the gospel in your homes.
                  </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is my testimony <q>ever-growing</q>? Are we doing things in our home that <q>best [cultivate]</q> testimonies? 
                  How can we <q>dramatically [increase] the study of the gospel in [our home]</q>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <q>
                    I have thought about the need for each of us to remove, with the Savior’s help, the old debris in our lives.
                  </q>
                </p>
                <p>
                  What <q>old debris in [my live]</q> do I need <q>remove, with the Savior's help</q>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <q>
                    The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of repentance. Because of the Savior’s Atonement, 
                    His gospel provides an invitation to keep changing, growing, and becoming more pure. 
                    It is a gospel of hope, of healing, and of progress. 
                    Thus, the gospel is a message of joy! Our spirits rejoice with every small step forward we take.
